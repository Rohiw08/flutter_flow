/// Represents the runtime (ephemeral) state of a single node.
///
/// This is **not persisted** â€” it exists only while the canvas is active.
/// It tracks UI and interaction-level details for a node, separate from
/// its core model ([FlowNode]) which contains structural data.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// // Mark node as selected
/// state = state.copyWith(selected: true);
///
/// // Mark node as being dragged and provide movement bounds
/// state = state.copyWith(dragging: true, extent: nodeDragExtent);
///
/// // Reset all transient flags
/// state = const NodeRuntimeState();
/// ```
