/// Represents a temporary connection being created by the user.
///
/// A connection is an ephemeral object that exists only during the edge
/// creation process. It tracks the visual state of a line being drawn from
/// a source handle to the current pointer position before the edge is finalized.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Started**: User begins dragging from a source handle
///    ```
///    FlowConnection(
///      id: 'temp-connection',
///      type: 'default',
///      startPoint: sourceHandlePosition,
///      endPoint: pointerPosition,
///      fromNodeId: 'node-1',
///      fromHandleId: 'output-1',
///    )
///    ```
///
/// 2. **Active**: User drags to find a target (endPoint updates with pointer)
///    ```
///    connection.copyWith(
///      endPoint: newPointerPosition,
///    )
///    ```
///
/// 3. **Completed**: User releases on a valid target handle
///    ```
///    // Connection is converted to FlowEdge
///    FlowEdge(
///      id: generateEdgeId(),
///      sourceNodeId: connection.fromNodeId!,
///      targetNodeId: targetNodeId,
///      sourceHandleId: connection.fromHandleId,
///      targetHandleId: targetHandleId,
///    )
///    ```
///
/// 4. **Cancelled**: User releases on invalid target or presses Escape
///    ```
///    // Connection is discarded
///    ```
///
/// ## Comparison with FlowEdge
///
/// | Property | FlowConnection | FlowEdge |
/// |----------|---------------|----------|
/// | Purpose | Temporary visual feedback | Permanent graph relationship |
/// | Lifetime | Milliseconds (during drag) | Until deleted |
/// | Start/End | Screen coordinates (Offset) | Node/Handle IDs |
/// | Validation | Real-time during drag | Validated on creation |
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// // During connection creation
/// if (isDraggingConnection) {
///   final connectionPainter = ConnectionPainter(
///     connection: currentConnection,
///     pathType: EdgePathType.bezier,
///   );
///   CustomPaint(painter: connectionPainter);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [FlowEdge], for permanent connections between nodes
///  * [FlowHandle], for connection points on nodes
